# This project is a deep dive into Embedded Linux, UI development, and ADAS automotive applications, allowing us to develop a smart vehicle infotainment system that enhances both driver experience and safety. 

🔹 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 
We built a fully functional infotainment system that gathers driver's luxury, drive assistance, security and safety by introducing various features. System is integrated on Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspbian Lite OS and LXQt, a light GUI integrated to the OS. To balance features quality and performance.

🚘 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 & 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
✅ 𝐕𝗲𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗹𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆 – Real-time monitoring of essential data. such as date, time, speed and vehicle's turn signals. As well as a speed control button.
✅ 𝗧𝗼𝘂𝗰𝗵𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲 – Enabling easy interaction with vehicle's functionalities. 
✅ 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 - Authentication system using face recognition.
✅ 𝗦𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 - Street signs recognition and alerts.
✅ 𝐍𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 - Utilizing google maps for navigation and location tracking.
✅ 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁 - Assisting individuals with disabilities to drive independently and easily using hand gestures.
✅ 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐫𝐭 - Alarm system to aware drivers for possible collisions.
✅ 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗛𝘂𝗯 – Custom-built media player for an enhanced in-car experience. as well as using radio feature.
In addition to..
🔹Future work capability to add (Over The Air) OTA feature to the system. to update the system's software remotely..
